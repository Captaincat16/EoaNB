EoaNB Development Repository

This repository is for sharing and cooperating with the process of developing EoaNB.
If you wish to support the development and join the team, join our Discord server and create an application. All members with the role Curia are granted access to the repository, and are given one 'Vicarius', or a team.

- All Vicarii are limited to pushing content in their own Vicarius branch.
- No incomplete, broken, or non-errorchecked content is to be pushed to the Vicarius branch. Errors caused by individual pushes are to be avoided at all costs.
- If procedural pushing (including incomplete content) is crucial to development, request a new branch.
- Merging any branch into the master branch (the distributed branch) will require a pull request which can only be initialised by an admin, and requires the approval of at least one admin. Errors are to be checked and minimalised by the admin who does the request.


If you do not wish to apply as a dev, you are free to fork the repository and modify it, redistribute it and privately use it, but the content of EoaNB is licensed under the GNU General Public License 3.0, which means you have to alert that what you're redistributing is a modified version of EoaNB.
We also do not tolerate redistribution of the components of EoaNB that are our creations without special permission.
