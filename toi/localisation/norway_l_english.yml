 NOR_norwegian_killed_by_prussian:0 "Infamous murder"

 ###Events###
 eoanb_norway.2.t:0 "The murder of Knut Grøte"
 eoanb_norway.2.d:0 "On 10 August 1863 Knut Grøte was murdered by Friedrich Priess and Knud Simonsen from Prussia and Denmark. Today, the Norwegian supreme court sentenced both to death. Maybe this will scare off all the other filthy criminals?"
 eoanb_norway.2.a:0 "How could such a thing happen?"

 eoanb_norway.3.t:0 "Constuction started on the Storting building"
 eoanb_norway.3.d:0 "After much planning, constuction of the Storting has started. A design competition was held in 1856, and after a vote in the Storting, the submission by Swedish architect Emil Victor Langlet was chosen as the final design of the building.\nSince 1854, the parliament has been using a conference room in the Royal Fredrick University, and the people's representatives are surely happy to finally move out once it is complete."
 eoanb_norway.3.a:0 "Very well"
 eoanb_norway.3.b:0 "About time!"

 eoanb_norway.3.t:0 "The Storting building is completed"
 eoanb_norway.3.d:0 "After roughly five and a half years of construction, the storting building is complete. This marks a significant step to Norwegian independence. Before this, the Storting used a conference hall in the Royal Fredrick University.\nThis building will be an artifact of the stable Norwegian regime, and will undoubtedly be a popular destination for history-lovers."
 eoanb_norway.3.a:0 "Very well"

 eoanb_norway.5.t:0 "Venstre has been established"
 eoanb_norway.5.d:0 "As the first formal political party in Norway, it will mark the start of a new era in Norwegian democracy. Venstre, literally \"Left\", is made up of MP's wanting to reform the Norwegian democracy. Its leader, Johan Sverdrup, has a goal of implementing parliamentarism in the Storting, but is met with strong opposition from the conservative members of parliament. \nInformal political parties have existed in the Storting before this, but have been limited to just that, informal political parties. Hopefully this will make it easier to know who to vote for."
 eoanb_norway.5.a:0 "Interresting"

 eoanb_norway.6.t:0 "Høyre has been established"
 eoanb_norway.6.d:0 "In reaction to Venstre being established earlier this year, the conservative members of parliament has decided to form their own political party. Høyre, literally \"Right\", is mostly made up of businessmen and powerful leaders. Representing conservative people in Norway, it will work against the proposals of Venstre, with a possibilty of cooperation with the moderate wing of Venstre."
 eoanb_norway.6.a:0 "Very well"

 eoanb_norway.7.t:0 "Vogt pressured by the Swedish crown"
 eoanb_norway.7.d:0 "Jørgen Herman Vogt, government leader since 1855 has been pressured by the King of Sweden to resign. This is because Vogt had a conflict with the king over his military appointments, and is now threatening Vogts position as leader of government."
 eoanb_norway.7.a:0 "Vogt stays in power"
 eoanb_norway.7.b:0 "Vogt's resignation"

 eoanb_norway.8.t:0 "Who should be Vogt's successor?"
 eoanb_norway.8.d:0 "After Vogt's resignation we are left with an obvious question; who should be his successor? Now, several prominient politicians have come with their own proposals, as well as the King of Sweden. Who should be his successor?"
 eoanb_norway.8.a:0 "The Crown Prince of Sweden Charles XV"
