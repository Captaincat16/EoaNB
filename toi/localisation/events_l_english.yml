 #Sepoy
 sepoy.1.t:0 "The Sepoy Mutiny"
 sepoy.1.d:0 "The year is 1857, and our country has suddenly been ripped into an abyss of turmoil and war. Rising conflict between the British East India Company and our people have led to an incident this morning that has sparked a war: A Mutiny in Meerut. Our country is now in a state of war with the company and on both sides mobilization efforts have just begun. Will this be the war that guarantees Freedom for India?"
 sepoy.1.a:0 "Fight the oppressors!"

 sepoy.2.d:0 "Our brothers in Sepoy have asked us, as one of the states not yet under British occupation, to join in their revolt! Shall we join them in their effort to drive out the colonialists from India?"
 sepoy.2.a:0 "Yes, join their glorious rebellion!"
 sepoy.2.b:0 "No, we would just get crushed under the British boot."
 sepoy.3.t:0 "Civilian Assistance"
 sepoy.3.d:0 "The hearts of our citizens are set aflame by the revolt, it seems, and in a major effort, many of them have come together during the last few days to erect fortifications in the cities of Delhi and Lucknow! Although hastily assembled, these forts will make it harder for the Brits to take these provinces!"
 sepoy.3.a:0 "Great!"
 sepoy.4.t:0 "Pressure from Sepoy"
 sepoy.4.d:0 "The Rebellion in Sepoy has severely affected our country - even though we are occupied by the British and therefore have to fight for them, our populace is extremely dissatisfied with our decision. The calls for us to abandon the British and join the Sepoy in their rebellion are getting louder and louder - what shall we do?"
 sepoy.4.a:0 "Join them - its about time we drove the British out."
 sepoy.4.b:0 "We must remain loyal to Britain."

 csa.11.d:0 "As we go about establishing our new nation, it is customary for every civilized nation to bear a flag to take up arms with and to salute. However, the only flag we have for us is the Bonnie Blue, which was used by the Republic of West Florida and first adopted by the Confederacy with the admission of Mississippi into the Confederacy. However, blue just won't do. That's a Yankee color. So as we work to establish ourselves, we have called a referendum for our people to choose what banner we should take up."

Also attempting to seize the position is Robert Toombs, a former officer and an outspoken critic of Davis. \n \nAlthough he did not run for office, there is also the possibility of Robert E.

 csa.22.t:0 "Rebirth of the Whig Party"
 csa.22.d:0 "Thoughts of the Confederacy being a One-Party Democracy are no more. Out of their coffin, the Whig Party has seen a resurgance recently. The Whigs, which were basically the 'We Are Not the Democrats' party, had died out in the Election of 1856 in favor of the Republican Party.

 csa.22.a:0 "Interesting..."
 csa.23.t:0 "Our Namesake"
 csa.23.d:0 "There are some Democrats who refused to join us in our fight for independence. The Northern Democrats, who were led by Stephen A. Douglas, betrayed our party. Now they claim to be the true Democratic Party. Naturally, we have far more Democratic Party support in the South, as many Nothern Democrats joined the Republican Party during the Election of 1860. But, there are some who have come up with an idea for a new party, the Dixiecrats. It signifies who we are, but adopting this name would mean that we give up the name and legacy of the Democratic Party to the traitors in the North."

 csa.28.d:0 "We recently received both good and bad news. The Good news was that the Mexicans had agreed to the purchase of Sonora and Chihuahua. However, the bad news is that the Yankees do not. They are demanding that we withdraw our attempt to purchase the states, or face war."

 csa.32.d_usa:0 "The Second Mexican War is over. We have secured enough territory from the Confederates to force them to accept our demands. The Purchase shall not go through, and they shall not reach the Pacific. Although we cannot annex them back, this is a good sign for the future."

 csa.33.t:0 "Confederates Wish to Purchase Cuba"
 csa.33.d:0 "We have recently received an offer from the Confederate States. They seem to have an eye for Cuba because of its rich resources and large potential labor force.

 utah.1.d:0 "President Buchanan has come to us with a proposal: They will be willing to pardon the Mormons for any acts of conflict, so long as they are willing to accept the Federal Government's authority. They also have stated that the government would not interfere with the Mormon religion. \n \nThis move is promising, but it would mean Brigham Young must step down from office as Governor, which is why we fought this Utah War in the first place. However, refusing this is almost certainly going to be seen as a declaration of Independence."

 utah.2.t:0 "Peace with Utah?"
 utah.2.d:0 "Although [UTA.GetName] had declared themselves independent, and we have been fighting a war with them, we have a much greater issue growing in the South.

 utah.4.a:0 "Rise my minions!"
 utah.5.t:0 "Mormon Desertion"
 utah.5.d:0 "We have begun to receive numerous reports of missing and deserting soldiers. The likely cause of this are the government's policies that have made the militia lose their Religious Zeal, however it could also be that the army seems to have enough soldiers and that there is no need for the zealous militiamen that we have been bringing in."

Such an organizational structure requires a certain development environment, which in our case is GitHub. Thanks to GitHub, every dev is able to work on the mod semi-independently. However, having the mod on GitHub with that many devs working on it automatically means that it is virtually impossible for us to regularly update the Steam version on the workshop. Consequently, the Steam version is only updated when major updates come out, being the reason for why EoaNB is perceived as \"idle\" or \"dead\" by many when only looking at the workshop page. Still, what has already been explained on the official workshop page is often overlooked.\n\nIf you want to experience an up-to-date End of a New Beginning, the first step would be to join our official Discord (linked on the workshop). After that, you can look up how to install the GitHub version in our #faq channel. Generally seen, the GitHub version of EoaNB is way more developed and advanced than the Steam one. Do remember, however, that the mod on GitHub is an in-development version, prone to changes, bugs and balance issues."

 mexico.1.d:0 "The Plan of Tacubaya is a plan conceived by the conservatives in order to overthrow the new radical Constitution of 1857 that had took away most of the power as well as the influence of both the Catholic Church and the Military. From there, Felix Maria Zuloaga went to join the Plan of Tacubaya but it is his choice on if he wants to publicly announce the plan."

 mexico.2.d:0 "On December the 19th, 1857 the moderately liberal president Ignacio Comonfort was approached by his friend Felix Maria Zuloaga to gain his support on the Plan of Tacubaya which was important as Ignacio Comonfort did not fully support the Constitution of 1857. All that remains is what the president thinks about this new idea."
 mexico.2.a:0 "The president supports the plan"
 mexico.3.t:0 "The Question about political opponents"
 mexico.3.d:0 "Upon hearing president Ignacio Comonfort, many of the radical liberals started protesting his actions including Benito Juárez who was next in line for the presidency. If this continues, the radical liberals may stir up more civil unrest within the nation but locking them up would only create more tensions between the parties."

 mexico.4.t:0 "The Question About Civil Unrest"
 mexico.4.d:0 "Civil unrest has only grown since the start of the lock-ups of radical liberals and tensions have been brewing between Mexico's different parties.

Upon him finishing his release of political opponents, the freed Benito Juárez went to claim his presidency in Mexico City as the Constitution of 1857 had stated but was then forced to move it to Guanajuato after the conservatives had occupied Mexico City which is the start of the Reform War.

Nearly two-thirds of our population still make a living through subsistence agriculture, most of them Hungarian. If we expect to become a strong industrial nation in the future, it is of the utmost importance that we begin our attempts to spread industry empire-wide, even though we may be unsuccessful."

Doing so would likely raise the happiness and content of the empire, bringing stability and peace to our subjects. \n\nHowever, our other advisors see this as a threat to the country's industrialization efforts. Additional heritage sites would cause the industry to suffer to an extent, which could cause us to be unprepared in the next war, which they predict will be won based on who has the best technology and industry. \n\nThe final decision is now up to you, Kaiser."

Discontent continues in the regions outside of Austria proper, causing many advisors to believe that the central government may be forced to give concessions to the provincial governments in order to prevent a repeat of 1848. With our former ally, Russia, no longer supporting us, it is of the utmost importance that the sentiment of revolution does not stir again, as the empire came close to collapse the last time it did. Oh, Kaiser Franz Josef! Lead the Austrian Empire to glory, unite its people, and bring justice to its enemies!"

The "Risorgimento" movement for Italian unification has been the worst of our worries regarding the Italian region. For centuries, the Italian peninsula has been split between many kingdoms and has been dominated by foreign powers, such as France or Austria. A unified Italian Kingdom would pose a large threat to current Austrian holdings in Northern Italy. Such a kingdom would also be a large threat to the continuation of the Austrian Empire, as it is highly unlikely that they will be willing to ally us. Therefore, we must do anything in our power to keep resistance to a minimum and to keep a unified Italy from coming to fruition."

The “northern provinces” are at serious risk of seeing themselves “again” in a situation of barbarism, as they are almost exclusively inhabited by Indians. In order to solve this chronic problem of lack of manpower, it is necessary to transfer African-American workers, who are more adaptable to the soil and tropical climate. These free and paid African-American workers will be responsible for developing the region's resources and infrastructure, they will be under a two to five year employment contract, during which time they must pay the costs of their transportation. After the end of this contract, the worker will receive Brazilian citizenship and a piece of land, thus guaranteeing his interest in staying and developing the region. The Binational Company of colonization of the Amazon basin will be responsible for the supply of labor and for the management of the works carried out in the northern region, while the Empire of Brazil is responsible for giving up the land for development.

The USA has a history of interventionism in foreign territories with American settlers, taking as a striking example the region of Texas that belonged to Mexico. After these settlers' discontent with the local administration, the US openly supported the secession of this region by placing it under its influence zone and subsequently annexing the territory. Although intervention in South America is less likely, it is not impossible to carry out, linked to old documents about Destiny Manifesto, dated 1850, in which Matthew Fontaine Maury, head of the Naval Observatory, proposes a plan for the occupation of the Amazon starting with the settlement of American slaves to "develop" the resources of the region and later taking it by force.

Much-needed buildings and infrastructure can finally be built.\nThe presence of such a large number of free blacks in the country will affect the Brazilian Empire in many ways, there will be discontent among the slaveholding elite and the increase in the abolitionist movement.\n It is possible that US intervention will take place if the colonists are unhappy with the region's policy and administration.

Julían Castro, the governor of the province of Carabobo and a conservative politician, spoke out agaisnt the government and rallied generals José Laurencio and Léon Febres for his cause. After a minor fight, the unstable government was couped in a revolution who took Caracas back to the conservatives. The victorious conservatives have convoked a national assembly in Valencia to stabilize the government and oficially stablish Julían Castro as the president. Also, deals have been made with Great Britain and France on a protocol to peacefully solve the situation between conservatives and liberals."

Both climbers were English. Many major Alpine peaks met their first ascents during the period. Although Alfred Will's ascent was not the first one, people commemorate the latter ascent, which marked the start of the Golden Age of Alpinism. The Golden Age of Alpinism was dominated by British Alpine climbers accompanied by Swiss and French guides. The era ended with Whymper's ascent of the Matterhorn, which caused death of 4 people; 3 well-known British Alpinists and 1 French Alpine guide. There had been 64 successful assaults on Mont Blanc during the period 1852 to 1857, and only 4 of them were not British."

 britain.23.d:0 "The Silver Age of Alpinism began after the Edward Whymper's ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 and ended with William Woodman Graham (1859-1932) ascent of the Dent du Geant in 1882. While the Golden Age of Alpinism (1854-1865) was characterized by the first ascents of many of the Alps' most dominant mountains, the subsequent silver age may be seen as consisting of the first ascents of those few worthwhile peaks left unclimbed, although these peaks were - and remained - largely unknown to the wider public. Many mountaineers from different nations joined the group of leading ascendants of Alps. Although British mountaineers did not dominate the era, still a lot of famous mountaineers in the Silver Age of Alpinism were British, such as Clinton Thomas Dent (1850-1912). His first ascents in the Alps include the Lenzspitze of the Pennie Alps (1870). There is a record that Queen Victoria of the Great Britain had spent her holiday in 1868, in Lucerne, Switzerland. This later derived more British attention on Switzerland."

 britain.24.d:0 "\"On Liberty\" is a philosophical work by the English philosopher John Stuart Mill, originally intended as a short essay. The work, published in 1859, applies Mill's ethical system of utilitarianism to society and the state. Mill attempts to establish standards for the relationship between authority and liberty. He emphasizes the importance of individuality, which he conceived as a prerequisite to the higher pleasures—the summum bonum of utilitarianism. Furthermore, Mill criticizes the errors of past attempts to defend individuality where, for example, democratic ideals resulted in the "tyranny of the majority". Among the standards established in this work are Mill's three basic liberties of individuals, his three legitimate objections to government intervention, and his two maxims regarding the relationship of the individual to society."

 britain.25.d:0 "In London fear of crime was a persistent, reoccurring issue thanks to a few instances of robbery and murder, and, of course, the news media. In particular, the so-called “garrotting” cases, where someone strangles someone else, often using their arm or a length of wire, cord, or cloth, seemed to touch the rawest nerve with the people of London, with the fear of garrotting reaching a fever-pitch in the 1860s. The weird thing about garrotting and how widely it was reported at the time is that it doesn’t actually appear to have been all that common; even during the supposed height of the “garrotting panic of 1862”. So why the panic? As it turns out, although garrotting itself was never a major problem in London, newspapers from the era positively loved reporting on it. This led to the few isolated cases that did happen being blown way out of proportion and reported on to such an extent that the people of London were led to believe the streets were filled to the brim with roving rabbles of ruffians armed with lengths of wire."

Alice was published in 1865, three years after Charles Lutwidge Dodgson and the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed in a boat, on 4 July 1862 (this popular date of the "golden afternoon" might be a confusion or even another Alice-tale, for that particular day was cool, cloudy and rainy), up the Isis with the three young daughters of Henry Liddell: Lorina Charlotte Liddell (aged 13, born 1849) ("Prima" in the book's prefatory verse); Alice Pleasance Liddell (aged 10, born 1852) ("Secunda" in the prefatory verse); Edith Mary Liddell (aged 8, born 1853) ("Tertia" in the prefatory verse)."

Before the first meeting of the Football Association in The Freemasons' Tavern on Great Queen Street, London on 26 October 1863, there were no universally accepted rules for playing football. Six meetings near London's Covent Garden, at 81-82 Long Acre, ended in a split between the Football Association and what would have become the future rugby ten years later. Both of them had their own uniforms, rituals, gestures and highly formalised rules. Between 1870 and 1872, the Football Association (FA) organised five representative association football matches between teams representing England and Scotland, all held in London.
